      "['CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\\n1 Introduction\\nIn the early days of the Internet with Web 1.0, people with Internet access were able\\nto access content in a ’read only’ format. Web 2.0 made it possible for the masses to\\ncreate their own content and make it available on the web through platforms such as\\nFacebook or Google. However, the users are dependent on a few large corporations.\\nWith this dependency come advantages, for example a very distinctive technological\\ninfrastructure. However, the advantages are offset by major disadvantages such as\\na lack of transparency, questionable political decisions and high costs, driven by the\\nhigh margins of the corporations. Web 3.0 wants to counteract these disadvantages\\nby gradually replacing monopolies with decentrally organized projects. Therefore,\\nWeb 3.0 is occasionally seen as a kind of revolution. Emerging technologies such as\\nblockchain and smart contracts enable a direct exchange between private comput-\\ners, thus avoiding the dependency on a few centralized entities. Decentralization is\\nintended to create a completely new type of transparency. By mining or buying cryp-\\ntocurrencies, so-called tokens, everyone can participate in the networks of projects\\nand influence them. Such projects can also be trading places for art. The decentral-\\nized nature in combination with new blockchain-based standards for unique assets\\nenables the general public to trade digital as well as real art. One such example is\\nthe ERC-721 standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\\nIn the past, alternative investments like art mainly used to be part of wealthy portfo-\\nlios. Auctions often took place in big cities like New York or Paris, where you either\\nhave to be lucky to get invited, or have to be able to pay the costs to get there. Not\\nonly expensive art, where potential investors were directly or indirectly preselected,\\nprevented art from being included in the mainstream portfolios. An easy accessible,\\naffordable and fast marketplace was missing. The problem for such a marketplace\\nwas probably not the fault of the ones who tried building it. The question was how\\nto prove ownership of an asset, and how to make that ownership easy transferable.\\nFungible assets, like common stocks, already have a standard for trading them. Now,\\nwith the evolution of the blockchain technology and smart contracts, a new way of\\ntrading ownership of non-fungible assets is on its way to the public.\\nNFTs are on the raise to disrupt the way how people can invest and trade alternative\\ninvestments like art. Investing in NFT art makes it possible to invest in a unique\\npeace of art and the only thing you need to participate in the auction is a WiFi\\nconnection. Of course art is more than just an investment object. This makes it\\nalmost impossible to predict future art prices. But before we look into the future of\\nNFT art as an investment alternative, we can try to understand the past.\\n1', 'CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\\nIn the following, the world of these NFTs will first be explained and a brief insight\\ninto the traditional art trade will be given, in order to then analyze the key question\\nof whether NFT art represents an investment alternative for everyone. This work\\nis mainly meant for retail investors who are interested in alternative investments,\\nespecially art. First we give a brief introduction into the blockchain technology in\\ngeneral. Then we will define what an NFT is and important coherent key words.\\nNext, we take a look into traditional art investing, to be able to compare investing in\\nNFT art with how this kind of alternative investing used to look like. The main part\\nconsists of analysing a big data set of NFT trades. We look at the top 100 NFT art\\ncollections on of the biggest NFT platforms when it comes to trading volume. The\\nanalysis mainly focuses on the achieved profit from the first purchase to the next sale.\\nWe will not try to predict future NFT prices. Instead, we check for anomalies in the\\nprofits in terms of the initial NFT price and the holding period, the time between\\nthe first and second trade of the NFT.\\n2', 'CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\\n2 Literature Review\\n2.1 Understanding NFTs\\nIn order to analyse NFTs and their characteristics as an investment alternative, it\\nis essential to first understand the underlying mechanics, such as decentralization.\\nTherefore, the following part will give a brief summary the individual parts of NFT\\nart investing.\\n2.1.1 Blockchain\\nGomber et al. (2017) describe a blockchain as sequence of data packages (blocks)\\nwhere each block consists of messages containing information about transactions.\\nThis sequence is an ever-growing list and is maintained by a decentralized network\\nof servers. This network validates the transactions of a new block using a consensus\\nmechanism. The use of cryptographic hash algorithms make it hardly impossible to\\nmanipulate the blockchain. Nakamoto (2008) presented the first concept of a peer-to-\\npeernetworkforelectronicpaymentsusingablockchain, todayknownasBitcoin. The\\npresented draft for payment processing using a blockchain made third-parties, like\\nbanks, unnecessary. With this new concept, the required mutual trust when making\\ntransactions is being replaced by the blockchain. Over the past years, a variety of\\nblockchains evolved. They can differ in purpose, functionality or even in the used\\nhash algorithm. The two blockchains with the largest market caps have been for\\nyears, and still are, Bitcoin and Ethereum. Measured in US-Dollar the native tokens\\nof both blockchains have a combined market cap of more than $500bn.1. It is not\\nnecessary to fully understand the technical mechanics how those blockchains work, it\\nis important to know that the anyone can see the full contents of the historic blocks\\nof a blockchain (Chen, Cong, and Xiao, 2021, p. 4-5). This is a key feature when\\nit comes to comparing traditional art investing with NFT art investing. Another\\nimportant fact about blockchains is, that since the individual blocks are build on\\neach other, participants check previous transactions, recognize potentially invalid\\ntransactions and thus there is no incentive to validate fraudulent transactions. In\\norder to motivate the network for the validation process and to compensate for the\\nenergy costs incurred, they benefit from transaction fees that users of the blockchain\\nhave to pay for each transaction on the blockchain (Chen, Cong, and Xiao, 2021, p.\\n12-13).\\n1according to cryptowat.ch on 20 October 2022\\n3', 'CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\\nNFTs are typically embedded in such a blockchain, provided the blockchain has the\\nrequiredfunctionalities. Wangetal.(2021)statedthattheconceptofNFTsoriginally\\ncomes from the Ethereum blockchain with the aim to distinguish tokens with unique\\nattributes. It is questionable if the concept of NFTs actually emerged from the\\nEthereum blockchain. The white paper of so-called Colored Coins from Rosenfeld\\n(2012), alreadypresentedasimilarconstructwherereal-worldassetscanbeembedded\\nin the Bitcoin blockchain, as non-fungible tokens. However, this idea has not caught\\non in practice.\\n2.1.2 Token\\nSince NFTs do without a central instance, decentralized applications are required on\\nthe blockchain in order to be able to process transactions without both parties having\\nto trust each other. With the introduction of the Ethereum network Buterin (2014), a\\nplatform emerged with built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing for\\nthe creation and execution of a variety of complex smart contracts. This is another\\nreason why Ethereum is the most popular blockchain for decentralized applications\\nsuch as a decentralized trading platform for NFTs.\\nSmart contracts are codes that automatically execute the predetermined content of\\nan agreement, such as releasing tokens once the terms of the agreement are met.\\nThey also have their own memory and account balance and, once connected to the\\nblockchain, can no longer be changed. Transactions are sent to the contract address,\\nwhich is unique. After successful validation by the network, the account balance of\\nthe contract is updated (Alharby and Moorsel, 2017, p. 127-128). On the Ethereum\\nblockchain, smart contracts hold exchangeable ERC-20 tokens (the standard for to-\\nkens that have an identical value and are therefore exchangeable), or the native\\ncurrency Ether, or non-exchangeable ERC-721 tokens, NFTs.\\nEther\\nThe standard for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain that have an identical value and\\nare therefore exchangeable, introduced by Buterin (2014) and further explained by\\nWood (2022).\\nERC-20\\nThe standard for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain that have an identical value and\\nare therefore exchangeable, introduced by Vogelsteller and Buterin (2015).\\n4', 'CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\\nERC-721\\nEquivalent to the ERC-20 standard, but for distinguishable and unique tokens, which\\nare hence not exchangeable, introduced by Entriken et al. (2018). \"ERC-721 is a\\nfree, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible or unique tokens on the\\nEthereum blockchain. While most tokens are fungible (every token is the same as\\nevery other token), ERC-721 tokens are all unique. Think of them like rare, one-of-\\na-kind collectables.\"\\n2.1.3 Minting\\nThe creation of an NFT is a process known as minting. To mint an NFT, a user—or\\nplatform acting on behalf of the user—calls a special function in the smart contract\\nwhere the NFT will reside. (Some marketplaces have a form of “lazy” minting in\\nwhich an NFT is minted on the blockchain only when it is first sold or transferred.)\\n2.1.4 NFT Art\\nAn NFT for an artwork consists of a digital pointer that is publicly and permanently\\nrecorded on a digital ledger - specifically on a blockchain. This pointer is an address\\nfor the content of the NFT, which usually but not always resides off chain, meaning in\\na system separate from the blockchain, e.g., a cloud server or a so-called decentralized\\nstorage system such as IPFS [31, 107].2 (An NFT may also include a pointer to\\nmetadata, e.g., the token name and description.) Recorded in association with an\\nNFT is an account identifier corresponding to its owner. These account identi\\ners are (randomized) numerical values, not real-world names, so NFT ownership is\\npseudonymous by default. Ownership can change, of course: NFTs can be bought\\nand sold or simply transferred to new owners, and thus moved to new accounts. To\\nunderstand how NFTs work, it’s important to be familiar with a few key con- cepts\\nthat we now brie y describe: wallets, private keys, minting, and marketplaces. In the\\nnext couple of subsections, we provide a little more technical detail on the systems\\nthat enable NFTs.\\n2.1.5 Wallets\\nWallets: Because an NFT resides on a blockchain, users must employ blockchain-\\nspecific software known as a wallet to buy, sell, create, and maintain possession of\\nNFTs. Wallet software runs on a user device such as a mobile phone or a laptop\\nand provides a graphical interface through which users can perform NFT-related\\n5', 'CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\\ntransactions. As the term wallet suggests, wallets also allow users to obtain and\\ntransact in cryptocurrency. Use of cryptocurrency is a requirement for NFT buyers\\nand sellers, as NFTs are usually bought and sold using the cryptocurrency native to\\nthe blockchains on which they reside.\\n2.1.6 Marketplaces\\nNFTs for sale can be listed on marketplaces, websites that act as front ends for the\\nblockchains on which the NFTs reside. Marketplaces can be viewed in an ordinary\\nbrowser (even without use of a wallet). In addition to advertising NFTs and interme-\\ndiating the sale of NFTs, marketplaces also provide technical tools for the creation\\nof NFT smart contracts. In return, they collect commissions on the NFT sales they\\nintermediate. As an example, one of the largest NFT markets today is OpenSea [37].\\nOpenSea NFTs reside on the Ethereum blockchain, and NFT prices on OpenSea are\\ntherefore quoted in Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum. (At the\\ntime of writing, 1 ETH is worth about $3000, but prices are extremely volatile.) To\\ncre- ate, buy, or sell NFTs, most users interact with OpenSea using a wallet known\\nas Metamask, which is available as a browser plug-in.\\nExecution within seconds\\n2.2 Traditional Art Investing\\nArt Market\\nTraditional art is typically traded either at auction or from a dealer. One of the\\nmajor auction houses is Christies.\\nMarket Participants\\nThere are three sources of demand: dealers, museums, and private collectors.\\n2.2.1 Traditional Art as an Investment\\nFirst studies like Anderson (1974) from 1974, have examined paintings as an invest-\\nment over the period form 1780 to 1970. Their results show that art investments on\\nthe one hand can provide positive annual return. But on the other hand compared\\nwith other investment alternatives, the risk-adjusted return is less attractive.\\nCompared to NFTs, which are traded on a blockchain that stores all the owner and\\nprice history of the individual asset, traditional art profits can not easily be calcu-\\nlated by comparing the purchase and sale of the asset. I.e.\\n6', 'CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\\nΠ= Profit\\np0= Asset price at time 0 (initial purchase)\\np1= Asset price at time 1 (sale after first purchase)\\nΠ=p1\\np0−1\\nAs a consequence, the profitability in literature on investments in traditional art, was\\nquantified by setting up an index of art prices.\\nAnderson (1974) first approximated that following the mean variance approach to\\nportfolio theory the total return must be similar to another equally risky asset. The\\nrisk is estimated by applying the Central Limit Theorem on the variance in annual\\nreturns of the constructed price indices.\\nAnderson (1974) came to the conclusion, that the price of a painting depends on the\\nreputation of the artist, the year it was sold and the size of the painting. Risk return\\nratios of paintings can be compared with those of common stocks. Lower risk return\\nratios may be due to the consumption value of the art.\\nThis is of course not 100% accurate since it is possible that only art prices one the\\nprimary market go up, but investors can not sell their art on the secondary market,\\nor at least not for a profit. This makes the whole comparability of traditional art\\nwith the NFT art market less significant. The analysis in this work will therefore\\nalso include traditional asset classes like a bond and stock market index.\\n2.2.2 Art and Money\\nFurther studies like \"Art and Money\" from Goetzmann, Renneboog, and Spaen-\\njers (2011) were still using a similar approach in 2009, like the from Anderson (1974).\\nGoetzmann, Renneboog, and Spaenjers (2011) investigated the impact of equity mar-\\nkets and top incomes on art prices. They constructed an art index and tested for\\ncorrelation between the art index, the stock market and wealth of the wealthy. The\\nwealth data used for their analysis rely on income tax data of the top 0.1% income\\nshare. Their results \"strongly\" suggest the existence of a long-term relation between\\ntop incomes and part prices. In other words, \"it is indeed the wealth of the wealthy\\nthat drives art prices\".\\n2.2.3 Buying Beauty: On Prices and Returns in the Art Market\\nRennebog and Spaenjers (2012) have studied the investment performance of tradi-\\ntional art with a more recent and larger data set than previous work has done.\\n7', 'CHAPTER 2.

Not everybody is able to investment millions for one\\nNFT. In order to find some Investment boundaries we take a look at the Capgemini\\nWorld Wealth Report 2022.\\nThe report states directly: \"NFTs are cryptographic assets on a blockchain with\\nunique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other.\\nThey cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency.\\nAmundi, Europe’slargestassetmanagerannouncedinearly2022thatitwouldlaunch\\nNFT products allowing clients to invest in companies operating in this space or di-\\nrectly in NFTs.

As a valu-\\nable asset, NFT artwork will also spur the growth of related industries, like insurance\\ncompanies with the technological knowledge to offer NFT artwork insurance for theft\\nor loss and NFT artwork experts to advise wealthy buyers.\\n2.3.1 NFT Boom\\nThe year of 2020 marked the beginning of mainstream artists publishing their work\\nin the form of NFTs. The sale of 10 NFTs for $6 million in December of 2020\\nby the Canadian musician Grimes was a landmark event in the music community\\n[143]. By early 2021, Rolling Stone declared that music NFTs had gone mainstream,\\nnoting that Kings of Leon became the first band to a release a new album as a non-\\nfungible token (NFT) in March 2021—with great success [124]. In summer 2021,\\nprominent traditional artist Damien Hirst [8] announced the sale of a series of 10,000\\nhand-painted dot-covered works on paper entitled The Currency. He gave buyers\\nthe option of receiving the physical work or having it destroyed and represented as\\nan NFT. Well-known auction houses such as Sotheby’s [70], Christie’s [54], Phillips\\n[109], and others also started to conduct NFT sales [139] as NFTs caught the eye of\\nin- fluential artists. One prominent example of the burgeoning acceptance of NFTs\\nin the art community was the $69 million sale by Christie’s of the NFT art piece\\n“Everydays” [67, 135] by digital artist Mike Winkelmann [48] (artist name Beeple).\\nThis sale propelled NFTs into the media spotlight and Beeple to fame outside the\\ncryptocurrency-art circles in which he was previously known. In the next section,\\nSection 5, we examine the most recent past year of NFT history, and discuss the\\ncurrent shape of the NFT ecosystem.\\n9', 'CHAPTER 2.

A description of what purports\\nto be the current state of the NFT ecosystem would no longer be current after a few\\nmonths. Therefore we instead offer a snapshot of the NFT landscape in early 2022,\\nspotlighting what we view as the most significant emerging and popular forms of\\nNFTs, with an emphasis on art and collectables. We organize this snapshot of the\\nstate of the NFT industry into three separate pillars: Section 5.1 deals with who the\\nmarket participants are, Section 5.2 considers what types of NFTs they interact with,\\nand Section 5.3 discusses the places where these market participants interact.\\n2.3.3 Categories\\nCategory Collection\\nFine Art Art Blocks, Fidenza, Damien Hirst’s Currency\\nProfile Picture Collections CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht\\nCollectibles Club Parallel Cards, NBA Top Shot\\nCrowdfunding Media Production Treeverse, ETH-MEN, Shibuya\\nGrassroots Community Building Loot, n project\\nFractional Ownership Fractional.art, SharkDAO, Founders DAO\\nIdentity Tokens Proof of Attendance Protocol (PoAP)\\nTable 1 Taxonomy of popular NFTs\\n2.3.4 NFTs as a Crowdfunding Mechanism\\nNFTs as a Crowdfunding Mechanism: Many projects in the NFT ecosystem use\\nthe sales of collections of art NFTs as a means of selling the intellectual prop- erty\\nrights to a character or participant in a soon-to-be-developed media collection (like\\na comic, movie, television show or game). The proceeds then bankroll further de-\\nvelopment of the media project, in a manner akin to crowdfunding sites like Kick-\\nstarter or GoFundMe. In the existing ecosystem, these NFT projects tend to focus on\\nbuilding ecosystems of intellectual property, stories and artwork associated with the\\nNFT collection, slowly growing an entire media franchise centered around the NFTs.\\nExamples of this kind of crowdfunding NFT in gaming include Treeverse [105] and\\nColony Online [56], both of which sold NFTs to raise money for development of Mas-\\nsively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG)-style video games. For\\nexample, Treeverse sold NFTs that were meant to be used in the upcoming game\\nas private homes for owners of plots of land. In Colony Online’s case, the NFTs\\n10', 'CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\\nrepresent animal characters meant to be used as the sprite, that is, the avatar, of\\nthe owner while interacting in the game-world. Comic-startup companies have also\\nused NFTs as a means to bootstrap a project: Both PixelVault PUNKS Comics [90]\\nand ETH-MEN [65] sell NFTs for tokenized comic books such that access to read the\\ncomic is restricted to people that have purchased the token. The PUNKS Comics\\nproject uses NFTs in a novel way. That project promises that in the future, a physical\\ncomic book they create will be mailed only to people who participate in a “burning”\\nevent in which users render their tokens unusable by transferring them to a special\\naddress that no one controls [90]. NFTs have also bled into video media. For exam-\\nple, the Forgotten Runes Wizards Cult [72] project used proceeds from the sale of a\\ngroup of 10,000 wizard-picture NFTs to fund a partnership with the animation studio\\nTitmouse to produce an animated television show about the lives of the wizards in\\nthe NFT collection itself [6]. The Shibuya.xyz project [98] is producing an Anime\\ntelevision show. The team behind the project sells “episode” NFTs on a regular basis\\nthat allow the person who purchases the NFT to vote on the trajectory that the\\nepisode will take, similar to the decision points in a choose-your-own-adventure game\\n[99].\\n2.3.5 Market Participants\\nCreators (Artists and Developers)\\nArtists and smart contract developers cre- ate the art and infrastructure that support\\nthe NFT ecosystem. Many of them come to acquire NFTs, not infrequently as gifts\\nfrom friends or fellow artists. As such, they constitute a special class of collectors\\nand tastemakers. While there have been examples of famous artists who were or\\nare also collectors (e.g., Damien Hirst [8]), the ease with which relationships can be\\nformed and NFTs can be transferred has made interactions among creators especially\\nvibrant within the NFT community. For instance, creators will partner to host digital\\nevents. Creators in the traditional art world have held co-hosted events as well, but\\nthe speed and geo-diversity of Internet culture means artists can hold digital events\\nmore often and more easily than events at a gallery. For example, the prominent\\ncryptoartist Farokh [68] holds weekly podcasts with other NFT artists, which are\\naccessible to anyone with an internet connection, in contrast to the exclusive events\\nheld by traditional galleries in the physical world [95, 96]. Another prominent NFT\\nartist, FVCKRender [76] is well known in the community for being an avid collector\\nas well as artist. His OpenSea profile, for example, shows that he owns over 1500\\nNFTs created by other artists [75].\\n11', 'CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\\n2.3.6 Real-World Interaction Tokens and Identity Tokens\\nOne last NFT col- lectable trend in the current ecosystem are identity tokens that\\nserve as both as collectibles and as tokens that prove some sort of fact about a\\nhuman being. One example of this is the Proof of Attendance Protocol (PoAP)\\necosystem [91]. PoAP NFT tokens are intended to be given out by organizers at\\nconferences as conference swag, like stickers or tee shirts. Often these tokens will\\nhave a corresponding piece of art for that year’s conference attached to the token.\\nLater, anyone can verify own- ership of a PoAP token, and view the list of tokens for\\nattendance to each unique event. These tokens can then be used by groups that want\\nto only interact with people that attended certain conferences or real-world events.\\nPoAP tokens are subvertible, in the sense that cheating conference organizers can\\ndistribute fake credentials. For higher quality identity NFTs, the Proof of Humanity\\n(PoH) [92] project grants NFT tokens to Ethereum users who prove they’re a human.\\nThe PoH system requires submitting video evidence answering a list of questions,\\nand it also utilizes a system in which people must have other people “vouch” for their\\nhumanness and the uniqueness of their asserted identity. Today, identity NFTs are\\nnotwidelyused. TheirusehasbeenlimitedtogatingaccesstoNFT-relatedpartiesor\\nto opportunities to purchase new NFTs [53, 142]. We believe, however, that identity\\nNFTs will assume a much larger role in the NFT ecosystem in the future. We discuss\\nthis idea in Section 6.\\n2.3.7 NFT Communities\\nSome discussion and interaction among NFT market par- ticipants occurs on sites like\\nInstagram, Facebook, and Tik-Tok, but the majority happens on two social media\\nnetworks: Twitter and the Discord chat application. Typically an NFT community\\nwill create a Discord server (a chat server) for community members, with gated\\nchat channels only accessible to members that have proven ownership of an NFT\\nin the associated collection. The largest of these communities tend to include tens\\nof thousands of users. For example, as of March 2022, the Bored Ape Yacht Club\\nhas 148,000 Discord users, and the Larva Labs (the company behind CryptoPunks,\\nAutoglyphs, and Meebits) Discord has 56,000 registered users. Twitter too serves as\\na platform for discussions among influencers, thought lead- ers, and regular users.\\nCommentary on Twitter is more public than Discord, since all Tweets are fed into\\none central timeline, as opposed to the segmented chat servers of Discord. Unlike\\nthe case in many industries, in the NFT space many influencers on Twitter have\\ndedicated pseudonymous accounts that discuss only NFTs and dis- play expensive\\ncollections. Examples include Cozomo de Medici (confirmed to be the famous rapper\\n12', 'CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\\nmusician Snoop Dogg), who as of March 2022 has 214.3K fol- lowers [57] and Punk\\n6259 who has 285.4K followers [40]. Traditional “influencers” also take part: Artists\\nand celebrities such as Steve Aoki [44], Logan Paul [32], and DeadMau5 [24] partner\\nwith different NFT collections, promote them on Twitter, and even release their own\\nNFTs. Twitter has embraced the NFT community, even offering a feature in its paid\\nTwitter Blue subscription service that allows users to distinguish their NFTs as their\\nprofile pictures with hexagonal portraits, as opposed to the usual circular portraits\\nof non-NFT users. The service validates that the NFTs are actually stored on-chain,\\nbut does not limit which NFT collections are allowed to be used or validate that the\\nNFT collection itself is legitimate or fake in any way.\\nInvestors\\nAnother category of NFT buyer is those who seek to earn a profit over the long term\\nbased on astute anticipation of the NFT community’s evolving tastes and market\\ndynamics. Some of these investors, both individuals and institutional investors, re-\\nsemble those in traditional art markets, as discussed in Section 3. Ex- amples of the\\nlatter include Three Arrows Capital [103, 104]. They are known for collecting com-\\nputer generated digital art pieces from a well-known curated online NFT Art gallery\\ncalled Art Blocks [49] and describe themselves as “a hedge fund established in 2012\\nand focused on providing superior risk-adjusted returns.” Smart contracts, however,\\nhave also given rise to NFT investors for whom coun- terparts in the traditional art\\nworld are rare or non-existent. For example, many NFT investors invest in fractional\\nownership or shares of high-value works of art, a rela- tively unpopular practice in\\ntraditional art markets. For example, fractional.art [73] allows any owner to frac-\\ntionalize her or his NFT in a smart contract vault, which issues partial shares of the\\nNFT that can then be traded and sold. This practice allows investors to gain expo-\\nsure to NFTs they could not afford to own in their entirety. Some investors invest\\nin NFTs by way of Decentralized Autonomous Organiza- tions (DAOs), smart con-\\ntracts that realize institutional investment with governance rules enforced by code.\\nFor example, members of SharkDAO [97] use a DAO to fractionalize Nouns [86], an\\nexpensive variety of NFT. There are many similar DAOs for other high-value NFTs,\\ne.g., CryptoPunks, Bored Apes, etc. (See Section 5.2 for further discussion of DAOs\\nfor NFTs.)\\nFlippers\\nThe last category of participant in the NFT ecosystem are flippers: a special class\\nof investor who hold NFTs for very short periods of time. As discussed in Section 3,\\nflipping is frowned upon and discouraged in traditional art markets. In NFT markets,\\n13', 'CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\\nit is a common practice, however (although it can be and sometimes is prevented by\\nhaving smart contracts enforce minimum holding periods on NFTs). Many NFT\\nflippers exhibit behaviors like those of arbitragers in traditional finan- cial markets:\\nThey employ technically sophisticated strategies to exploit arbitrage opportunities\\nbetween different marketplace platforms, gain priority access to NFTs before the\\ngeneral public to sell at a higher price (frontrunning [115]), and so forth. Indeed,\\nsome prominent arbitragers such as MEVCollector [81, 82] and SneakyN- injaPants\\n[100, 101] publicly discuss and arbitrage both cryptocurrency and NFT transactions\\nin search of profit.\\n2.3.8 Measuring Profitability\\nTop profits driving traditional art prices already indicate a restriction for people\\nhaving an yearly investment budget of less than, for example, $1000.\\n2.3.9 Who Should Buy and Own NFTs?\\nThe ability to create, buy, and trade NFTs at present is more open than in tradi-\\ntional art markets. NFT artists must only have access to a cryptocurrency wallet\\napplication, make an account on a platform like Opensea, and be able to pay trans-\\naction fees to mint their NFTs. NFT buyers have the same technical requirements.\\nAlthough access to traditional fine art markets is limited by gallerists and auction\\nhouses, which often exclude unknown buyers or those with a reputation for reselling\\nworks, the traditional art market is still notorious for money laundering [117]. With-\\nout gate-keeping by gallerists and auction houses, anyone with the resources can\\nparticipate in the NFT market. This openness could lead to a more democratized\\nart market, however, it raises regulatory concerns. Identity verification standards to\\npurchase and trade NFTs are not universally enforced. In the broader cryptocurrency\\necosystem, identity verification and en- forcement against money laundering and the\\nfinancing of terrorism has been left to exchanges, the companies that allow trading\\nof cryptocurrency for government-issued currencies and vice versa. With identity\\nverification completed as a separate step at the discretion of private companies for\\nmanycryptocurrency-to-cryptocurrencytransactions, legalenforcementagainstcrim-\\ninal users can be challenging. As NFTs embody large amounts of value, their use for\\nillicit purposes as an alternate form of digital wealth to cryptocurrency will raise\\nchallenges for national financial law en- forcement agencies. One potential solution\\nwould be to require identity verification using a centralized or decentralized identity\\nsystem before an individual can interact with NFT trading platforms. As with know-\\nyour-customer (KYC) / anti-money- laundering (AML) systems in the traditional\\n14', 'CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\\nfinancial system, sanctions lists could arise for users who have engaged in criminal\\nactivity.\\n2.3.10New Financial Instruments with NFT Artworks\\nAn NFT artwork can be easily fractionalized and owned by groups of collectors using\\na smart contract that custodies the work and parcels out ownership shares. These\\nownership shares can be publicly viewed, ownership can be proven, and shares can\\nbe resold or further fractionalized. Buyers of NFTs have in some cases achieved\\nmassive and rapid price appreciation by fractionalizing ownership and selling shares.\\n(Their approach is analogous to real estate developers who buy parcels of land and\\ncarve them into lots.) For example, DOGE, an NFT of an image of a dog, sold\\nfor a total of 11,000 ETH once fractionalized after its initial purchase for 1,696.9\\nETH [137]. Protection against fractionalization using price caps by artists hoping to\\ndiscourage price speculation for their work can be found in Section 6.1. Art funds in\\ntraditionalmarketshavenotbecomepopular. Incontrast, therehasbeenasignificant\\ngrowth of funds where investors buy re-sellable shares of a selec- tion of NFTs from\\nsuccessful collections. These funds are roughly like index funds, allowing investment\\nin a portfolio of NFT artwork that is broadly representative of a segment of the NFT\\nmarket. While the reason for the popularity of such funds in the NFT community is\\nunclear, it no doubt helps that NFT artworkscan be bought and sold quickly, without\\nthehassleoftransportingandsecuringvaluablephysicalobjects. NFTfundstypically\\noperate in a decentralized manner as DAOs (see Section 5.2). DAOs enable funds\\nwith no managers, only stakeholders, and could revolutionize collective ownership of\\nfine art [14]. Similarly, one could imagine NFT art museums operating as DAOs,\\nwith patrons guiding acquisitions and exhibitions.\\n2.3.11The Bot Art Market\\nA future is conceivable in which machines shape or even dictate tastes in art markets.\\nMachine learning can be used to create NFT artwork and also to purchase it. Thus\\nthe principles of taste that govern the desirability of NFTs may deviate from human\\ntaste. While this seems to be a futurist prediction, machine learning is already used\\nto generate NFT artwork. For instance, an algorithm called Botto generates art and\\neach week mints a piece as an NFT based on votes from the Botto community [15].\\nThe Gan Apes [30], a series of NFT artworks, are created by feeding existing NFT\\nartworks called the Bored Apes into a machine learning system called a Generative\\nAdversarial Network (GAN). What is created is an image generally recognizable as a\\nversion of a Bored Ape, but differing in form, color, and style. Machine learning has\\n15', 'CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\\nanother role to play in NFT markets as well. NFTs more closely resemble traditional\\nfinancial instruments than traditional works of fine arts, as discussed in Section 6.2.\\nFinancial trading firms commonly use machine learning to craft trading strategies.\\nNFT trading is a natural application of machine learning algorithms, one that will\\ninevitably arise if it hasn’t already. An interesting twist, however, is that such algo-\\nrithms may take as input not just data on market dynamics, but also characterization\\nof the style of NFTs, i.e., trade in part based on NFT styles. Beyond prediction of\\nNFT market movements to devise profitable strategies, ma- chine learning algorithms\\ncould also discover ways to manipulating art markets, i.e., strategies to influence the\\ntrading behavior of market participants. The result would be use of machine learning\\nalgorithms not just to predict market movements, but to influence them for profit.\\n16', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\n3 Analysis\\nThe previous chapters gave a introduction into the world of NFTs, traditional art\\ninvesting and finally, the combination of both: NFT art investing. This chapter puts\\nthe theory into practise. By analysing historic NFT art investments, this analysis\\nprovides insights, which are especially relevant for potential investors considering to\\nenter the NFT art market. The analysis begins with describing the available data,\\nand preparing it for deeper analysis. In the next step, the profitability is broken down\\nin detail. By comparing contiguous transactions, the analysed profitability represents\\nrealised returns by actual trades and thus ensures practical relevance. At the end of\\nthe analysis part, the from the data induced advantages and disadvantages will be\\nfaced.\\nNote: data gathering, data clean-up, and the analysis was all independently per-\\nformed using python. All graphs included in this work were created independently\\nand by own calculation, with the use of the described data. The according code can\\nbe found on github.com/vfcapital/bachelor-thesis.\\nFigure 1 Transactions per Day\\n17', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\n3.1 Data\\nThis section describes the data which was used for analysing the profitability of NFT\\nart investments. First, it needs to be decided which NFTs are being included in the\\nanalysis. As as basis, this work chose the top 100 art collections from opensea.io.2\\nOpensea.ioisoneofthemajorexchanges, whenitcomestomintingandtradingERC-\\n721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.3The top 100 collections ranking is selected\\nby all time trade volume measured in the ethereum native currency ether (ETH),\\nand filtered by the NFT subcategory \"art\". For the time span of retrieving the data,\\nthis work chose the 01 January 2019 until 03 October 2022. This might seem like an\\nextraordinary short period of time when comparing to data sets of traditional art,\\nwhere typically several centuries of history investment transactions can be analysed.\\nAs in the previous chapter mentioned, NFTs and its ERC-721 standard was first\\npublished in 2018. Hence, much longer time spans are just not possible. Looking\\nat the finally retrieved data in the following section of the actual analysis, one will\\nnotice that most of the NFT art trades took place in late 2021, see figure 1.\\nCount of Collections 89\\nCount of NFTs 164,195\\nCount of Transactions 437,173\\nMedian Transaction Count per Collection 4,443\\nMedian NFT Count per Collection 1,814\\nMin.

Volume per Collection $967,988,903.95\\nTable 2 Total Transaction Volumes per Collection\\nPlainly looking at the transaction distribution, the analysed data set raises questions\\nof potential selection issues. An argument against potential selection is the fact, that\\nthe selected top 100 collections are composed by all time transaction volume and\\nthe collection in the data set with the lowest transaction volume is called \"SUPER-\\nPLASTIC: SUPERGUCCI\" with an total volume of $14,695.95. This relatively low\\nall time transaction volume indicates that the most important NFT art collections\\nare included in the data set. For comparison, the collection with the highest overall\\ntransaction volume is \"BoredApeYachtClub\" with a total of $967,988,903.95. More\\nmetrics on the data can be extracted from table 2. At this point it needs to be\\nnoted, that the data on the one hand contains primary as well as secondary market\\ntransactions, since both types are possible on the opensea.io exchange.

The data from ether-\\nscan.io comes directly from the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring a high data quality.\\nAdditionally, in the next steps, the clean-up process of the data will be described in a\\nshortly manner. It turns out that after the data set clean-up only 89 of the initial 100\\nretrieved collections remain in the data set. A final count of remaining n=437,173\\ntransactions within the past 3.5 years can still be seen as a well representation of the\\noverall NFT art market.\\nPurchase Prices Sell Prices\\nCount 272,978 272,978\\nTotal Value $901,219,605.94 $1,486,589,361.26\\nMedian $971.97 919.58\\nMean $3,301.44 $5,445.82\\nStd.

Value Collection BoredApeYachtClub BoredApeYachtClub\\nTable 3 Trade Prices Overview in US-Dollar\\nWhile retrieving the data of each collection for this work, a strong pattern has been\\noccurring for a majority of collections. Most of the transactions of each collection\\nhappened on the first days of launching the collection. This pattern matches the\\nin the previous chapter mentioned behavior of NFT investors always looking for the\\nnext hyped collection. This can also be shown in numbers. Across all collections, 5%\\nof all transactions happen on the first day after the first trade was made. 51.30%\\nof all transactions happen within the first 10 days. Having the majority of trades\\nwithin the first trading days displays a cluster risk in terms of liquidity. This issue\\nwill be caught up on in the discussion part. Another potential issue with the data\\nset could be survivorship could cause upwards bias in the analaysis, as Goetzmann,\\nBrown, et al. (1992) exemplified. This potential issue is countered by the nature of\\nhow a blockchain works. Every transaction settled on the blockchain stays on the\\nblockchain and can not be reverted. As long as opensea.io did not manually remove\\nany collection from the top 100 art collections of all time transaction volume, the\\nlist is complete. Even NFT collections which are not being traded anymore and lost\\ntheir complete attraction to investors, are included in the analysis.\\nAs already mentioned and table 2 also shows, only 89 of the initial 100 NFT art\\ncollections remain for the final analysis. This is caused by the clean-up process. This\\nprocess is important to for achieving reliable results and avoiding unnecessary errors\\nin the calculation.

This work starts with a table which contains the following columns:\\nTransaction Hash, Timestamp (inclusive milliseconds), Transaction Action Type,\\nBuyer Wallet Address, Collection Name, Token ID, NFT Type, Quantity, ETH Price,\\nUS-Dollar Price and Market Place\\nFirst, a unique NFT identifier is created by merging the collection name with the\\ncollection specific token id. Since the token id is not a unique identifier, merging\\nboth columns into one makes further calculation easier. Next, checks are being run\\non the data to ensure that the market place is for all the same opensea.io. Similar\\nto the market place, a check ensures the NFT type to equal the Ethereum standard\\nERC-721. The transaction action type has to be \"bought\". This excludes some in-\\ncluded transactions where the investor won the auction but the trade did not settle.\\nIn the next step, all transactions having a buy price of $0 are excluded from the\\ndata set. This might seem controversial to some. The background of $0 buy prices\\nare typically a marketing strategy for some selected investors, made by some collec-\\ntions. Potential investors can not rely on such special treatments, and the resulting\\nprofits from such transactions would bias the final results by increasing the mean\\nprofits significantly. The amount of such transactions is still low, compared to the\\ntotal count of transactions. The following step cleans out a much higher number of\\ntransactions. In order to calculate realised profits of NFT art transactions, at least\\ntwo transactions are required per unique NFT id. Every transaction of unique NFTs\\nonly having exactly one transaction in the whole data set will be excluded for the\\nprofit analysis. Additionally, all duplicated transactions are excluded from the data\\nset. It is possible having multiple transactions with the same transaction hash. This\\nhappens on opensea.io when an investor buys multiple NFTs and pays them in one\\npayment. But it is not possible having the same transaction hash and the same NFT\\nid.\\nOncetheclean-upisdone, 437,173transactionsremaininthedataset, whereactually\\nrealised profits can be calculated from. This is done by first sorting the table by NFT\\n20', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\nid and timestamp. Afterwards, the transactions from each unique NFT, unequal to\\nthe particular first transaction of each NFT are shifted up to the prior transaction,\\nresulting in a new table. This new table represents actual trades including the price\\nof the buy and the following sell transaction, which makes it possible to calculate\\nrealised profits. Both, the profit resulting from the buy and sell ETH prices, and\\nfrom the US-Dollar prices are calculated. By having both metrics, the impact of\\nETH measured in US-Dollar can be analysed separately from the plain change in\\nvalue of the NFT itself. The profit is calculated using log returns:\\nΠC=ln(PC(t)\\nPC(t−1)) (3.1)\\nwhere\\nΠC∶log-return of the trade, calculated using the prices measured in currency C\\nC∶either ETH, or US-Dollar\\nPC(t)∶sell price denoted in currency C\\nPC(t−1)∶buy price denoted in currency C\\nThe final table of the trade profits contains the following columns:\\nUniqueNFTID,NumberofTradeforUniqueNFTID(restartingat1foreveryNFT),\\nPurchase Timestamp, Sell Timestamp, Holding Period, Purchase Price in ETH, Sell\\nPrice in ETH, Log Return in ETH, Purchase Price in US-Dollar, Sell Price in US-\\nDollar, Log Return in US-Dollar, Collection Name, Seller Address, Buyer Address,\\nPurchase Hash, Sell Hash\\nNow the data is prepared and ready to be analysed.\\n3.2 Analysing NFT Art Trades\\nThe final log-returns data set consists of 89 NFT art collections covering 164,195\\nunique NFTs and 272,978 trades with information on their profitability. Descriptive\\nstatistics of the trades data set can be extracted from table 3 and 4. This work can\\nnow start diving into the profitability of NFT art investments\\nLet’s start with looking at the plain returns distribution in figure 3. This histogram\\nshows the count of each profit bucket on the y-axis. The x-axis represents the profits\\nin 100%, calculated using the equation (3.1) and C=US-Dollar. The distribution\\nshows typical characteristics of log-normal distributed returns. All returns exceeding\\n1000% of profit are included in the last bin, marked in pink, for visibility reasons.\\nThe relative count of outlier trades having a profitability of more than 1,000% makes\\n21', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\nFigure 2 Price History ETH\\nSource: coinmarketcap.com\\nup a small relative amount, with 0.4%. It might look like the majority of trades have\\na profit less than 0%, but in total 52.20% of the trades were profitable in absolute\\nvalues. Figure 4 shows the distribution of profitable investors. More precisely, it\\nshows the count of wallet addresses who bought an NFT and sold it for a log-return\\nin terms of US-Dollar.\\nComparing the transactions timestamps from 1 with the performance of the trans-\\naction currency ETH in figure 2, one could argue that this was due to exchange rate\\nrisk. The ratio of profitable trades, measured in C=ETH, is almost the same with\\n53.81%. When comparing the log-returns calculated with ETH and the log-returns\\ncalculated with US-Dollar, the profits in US-Dollar are on average 81.49% higher.\\nThis divergence is caused by some huge outliers. The median difference between the\\nUS-Dollar profit and the ETH profit is with -0.3% almost equal to zero, as figure\\n5 shows. The differences are simply calculated by subtracting the profits using C=\\nETH from the profits using C=US-Dollar. As this plot of differences in ETH and\\nUS-Dollar profits shows, on average both profits are equal. To make comparability\\neasier, the following hedonic approach of analysis the NFT art profitability focuses\\non the profits measured in US-Dollar.

This\\nperiod of huge profits is followed by median log-returns settling down at around 100%\\nin mid 2021. Comparing these numbers with stock market trades for example, the\\nreturns are large. In the time of writing, the weekly median log-returns evened out\\nat around 0% profit. This indicates that NFT art investments have become harder to\\ngain profitability. Since these numbers do not include the underlying holding period\\nof each trade, figure 6 does not tell much about the overall profitability of NFT art\\ninvesting. Therefore it is necessary to dig deeper and break down the components of\\nthe trades.\\nFigure 7 does exactly that. It shows the median log-return of each holding period in\\ndays in the data set. For readability reasons the graph only shows median log-returns\\nof 1,000% or less. The median of possible holding periods measured in days is 12.\\nLooking at figure 7 12 days of median holding period might seem too small, but this\\nrepresents an import investor behaviour. 11% of buying and directly reselling the\\nNFT, happen within the same day. This behaviour matches the way the NFT art\\n24', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\nFigure 5 US-Dollar Profits vs. ETH Profits\\nmarket was described in chapter two. The amount of NFTs issued per collection are\\nlimited. Additionally many collections experience a big hype, even before the art\\nwas released. Those two factors lead to traders, or sometimes trading bots, being\\nlucky to get the NFT on release from the primary market and directly selling on the\\nsecondary market. Since the median log-return for a holding period of zero days is\\npositive, this trading strategy seems to add up relatively often. It appears that in the\\nmid range holding period the median log-returns all are negative. This fact indicates\\nthat holding NFT art for several months had not been profitable in the past. In the\\nlong term, a holding period of one year or longer, the median return profits suddenly\\nspike. These spikes can be explained by the relatively short time of existence of the\\nNFT technology, especially the ERC-721 token standard. The data set started in\\nearly 2019 whereat the count of trades and median returns of NFT art began to rise\\nin end of 2020. On top of the rising NFT hype, as explained above, the exchange\\nrate of ETH took of in the same time. Early investors from 2019 hence profited from\\nboth hypes. There are still median values in the negative profit area. This is \"all or\\nnothing\" pattern is typical for alternative investments in general and point out that\\nNFT art might not be as comparable to investments in common shares or bonds,\\nas many cryptocurrencies are. Such relationships will be described in more depth\\nat the end of this analysis and are visualized in figure 12 and 13. Another part of\\n25', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\nFigure 6 Weekly Rolling Log-Returns\\nthe holding period graph (figure 7) is a linear regression of second order. Holding\\nperiods within one year seem to fit this quadratic behaviour even though many data\\npoints are not in the 95%-confidence interval. Many data points being in the 95%-\\nconfidence interval would indicate that the profit could be predicted plainly by the\\nexpected holding period. The pearson correlation coefficient between the profit and\\nthe holding period is 0.01, suggesting a low correlation.

He strongly suggests to avoid short term trading. Among the\\nholding period, this work analyses how the trade frequency within the NFT art\\nmarket potentially influences the resulting returns. First, the trading frequency per\\ncollection is being broken down. The amount of trades per collection compared with\\nthe floor price of the according collection is negatively correlated having a correlation\\ncoefficient of -0.36.

Therefore\\nit is worth looking at the profitability per trade counts. The upper graph of figure\\n9 shows the median log-returns per count of trades per collection. As the linear\\nregression in this graph directly suggests, the count of trades per collection has a\\nrelatively low but positive impact on the median log-return. The relatively small\\nslope can be interpreted as the count of trades only has a small impact on log-returns\\nand is not an important indicator for potential investors. On the other hand from\\nthe fact that the slope is positive it can be concluded that a higher trade count\\nmight lead to a higher liquidity and therefore a larger demand for that collection.\\nFigure 8 provides an overview of the total turnover across all NFT art transactions\\nper month for the last two years. Comparing this graph with the weekly median\\nlog-returns from figure 6, it appears that liquidity and profits don’t match perfectly.\\nComparingtheliquidityspikeinmarch2022withthemedianlog-returnsinthattime,\\nthe log-returns should be comparably higher if drawing the conclusion from higher\\nliquidity follows higher demand, resulting in higher returns. Besides this difference\\nin development within those two graphs, the absolute change in total turnover had\\ndropped significantly compared to the time of the big NFT hype at end of 2021 and\\nthe beginning of 2022.

This indicates that the overall prices of NFT art have dropped significantly\\nafter the described hype.\\nAmongthetradespercollection, thefrequencyoftradesperinvestorandtheresulting\\nprofitability is relevant for potential investors.

As an easier\\nfashion the count of trades per investor can be compared with the resulting median\\nlog-returns. A possible expected outcome would be that more trades imply more\\nexpertise of the investor within the NFT art space, and therefore achieve higher\\nreturns. The lower graph of figure 9 visualizes this comparison. Looking plainly at\\nthe median profits, no obvious trend can be observed. Adding a linear regression\\nline to the graph shows a slightly negative trend. This finding is being underlined by\\nmost investors having traded less than 100 times achieved positive median returns.\\nConsidering this historic data it can be desirable to also focus on qualitative factors,\\nwhen it comes to NFT art investing.\\n28', 'CHAPTER 3.

ANALYSIS\\nclustered by their initial purchase price measured in US-Dollar. One will directly\\nnotice the bucket having a purchase price of less than $100. The median log-return is\\nwith almost 120% by far the best performing bucket. The mid price buckets ranging\\nbetween $1,000 and $25,000 all have a negative median return. The more expensive\\nNFTs one the other hand achieve positive returns on median. A possible explanation\\nfor that pattern is that unpopular and relatively cheap collections go through phases\\nof hypes after their release. NFTs in the mid price range possible do not get much\\nattention. This might reflect a bigger phenomenon, wealth inequality. As explained\\nby Keister, 2000, there is gap between the top one percent of the wealth of people\\nin America and the rest. Whereas the lower income segment inside the historic NFT\\nart investors mostly invests in NFTs costing $1,000 or less, the comparably wealthy\\ninside that space mostly invest in assets costing at least $25,000. As a result the mid\\nprice segment get excluded from phases of hypes.\\nThese results might look promising and in favor of the affordable NFT art, initially\\ncosting less than $1,000. Figure 11 goes one step further and shows the above ex-\\nplained performance metric, the sharpe ratio per price range. Now, also taking the\\nvolatility of the log-returns into account, the lower price segment disappears almost\\nentirely from the graph. Trades of initially higher priced NFT art remain visually\\nprofitable, whereas the mid price segment still seems unattractive and demonstrate\\nnegative sharpe ratios. By subtracting the risk-free rate from the asset profit and\\ndividing the standard deviation, the uncertainty of achieving the above displayed\\nreturns is also considered. Historic investors of lower priced NFT art had achieved\\na median log-return of almost 120%, but the fluctuations among all log-returns had\\nbeen so large making it hard to calculate with such median log-return for the future.\\nThe higher priced NFT art initially costing more than $100,000 achieved a positive\\nsharpe ratio of more than .5. These results match with the ones of Rennebog and\\nSpaenjers (2012), where expensive art turned out as profitable. For comparison, the\\nS&P 500 achieved a sharpe ratio of 1.77 in the same time frame. The comparison of\\nthose two sharpe ratios should not be taken too serious since the NFT art returns in\\nthe used data set are no time series like the S&P 500. For calculation of the S&P\\n500 sharpe ratio, the total profit from the time frame mid 2019 till October 2022 was\\nused. For the NFT art the median profit of each price bucket was used. For better\\ncomparability this work created a NFT art index. Unlike in traditional historic art\\nprices the returns of NFT art contain extreme outliers of partially millions of percent\\nin profit. To avoid biasing rare outliers the monthly rolling median profit was used\\nwhen creating the index visualized in figure 12. For plotting the comparison assets\\nETH price and S&P 500, the same rolling and median procedure was applied. In or-\\n32', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\nder to compare all three time series, the graph shows the accumulated returns adding\\non the base of 100%.\\nFigure 12 NFT Art Market and the Stock Market Equity Curves\\nSource: Historic price data (other than NFT Art Index) from yahoo.finance.com\\nSince there was almost no trade activity in 2019 within the data set, the time series\\nfor the NFT art index starts in early 2020. As expected by previous insights from this\\nanalysis, the NFT art index demonstrates large up and down movements. The ether\\nprice represented by the dashed line shows the rise and fall of this cryptocurrency,\\nwhich is already known from figure 2. Comparing the NFT art index with the S&P\\n500 the differences in volatility stand out. While the stock market index S&P 500\\nsteadily increased up to 25% until the beginning of 2022, the NFT art index already\\nhad roller coaster drive behind it. The NFT art index increased tenfold within a few\\nmonths and dropped almost entirely right before multiplying by ten again. At the\\nend of the sample period the ETH price as well as the NFT art index increased by\\nseveral hundreds of percent whereat the stock market index gained less than 20%.\\nThe following figure 13 substantiates these relationships, together with some more\\ndifferent asset classes and their monthly median returns. It appears that the NFT art\\nindex has a slightly positive correlation with the native cryptocurrency ether of the\\nEthereum blockchain and also with oil. Altogether the NFT art index shows little\\n33', 'CHAPTER 3.

Looking at this correlation heat\\nmap in figure 13 a 3×3cube in the top left attracts attention. The correlations among\\nthe S&P 500, ether and bitcoin appear to be higher than most of the other correlation\\ncoefficients. As a conclusion from this heat map one can say that cryptocurrencies\\nmay be positive correlated with the stock market and other assets, but NFT art on\\nthe other hand shows little market correlation.\\nFigure 13 Correlation between NFT Art and Other Asset Classes\\nSource: Historic price data (other than NFT Art Index) from yahoo.finance.com\\nReal estate is reflected by VanEck Global Real Estate UCITS ETF\\n3.3 Discussion on Profitability\\nThe previous section analysed the historic behaviour of the NFT art market, with\\nfocus on giving an objective overview of this new asset class to potential investors.\\nIn this last part of the analysis both, possible advantages and disadvantages of NFT\\nart investments will be discussed, utilizing the previous findings.\\n34']\n"
