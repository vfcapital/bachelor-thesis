      "['CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\\n1 Introduction\\nAlternative investments are non-traditional assets that are used to either drive ad-\\nditional profits or bring diversification into investment portfolios, as described by\\nAnson, Fabozzi, and Jones (2011). Art is such an instrument, acting as a store of\\nvalue. In the past, art investments used to be an investment alternative mainly for\\nthe wealthy. Auctions taking place in big cities like New York or Paris create ob-\\nstacles to becoming an art investor. One either needs to be lucky to get invited or\\nneeds the money to pay the costs to get to the auction. As a result, art was not part\\nof the average investment portfolio. An easily accessible, affordable, and fast way of\\ntrading ownership of art pieces was lacking. Traditional fungible assets, like common\\nstocks, already have a standard way of trading them. The blockchain technology il-\\nlustrates a potential solution to the problems of traditional art investing. With smart\\ncontracts on the Ethereum blockchain, a new standard of trading ownership could be\\nintroduced. The solution, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), creates the required trust in\\nownership of unique items and facilitates trading the ownership. Additionally, the de-\\ncentralization aspect brings transparency, security, and equal opportunities into the\\ngame of art. This leads to the central question of the resulting new asset class NFT\\nart, an investment alternative for everyone. Of course, everyone is an exaggeration\\nand can not mean everyone in this world. In this context, the term everyone is limited\\nto everyone looking for new investment opportunities. To include as many potential\\ninvestors as possible, this work incorporates art pieces costing even less than $100.\\nThe results of this analysis are meant for both institutional and retail investors and\\nshall provide a first overview of NFT art profitability. As the outcome of the analysis\\nwill show, the new asset class NFT art exhibits similar investment characteristics as\\ntraditional art.\\nThis work is structured as follows. First, the new NFT technology will be introduced.\\nAs a benchmark, traditional art investments will be described. In the next step, the\\ncombination of both art investments and NFT technology will be exemplified. The\\nmain part is the analysis of real-world data, beginning with describing the data set.\\nThe most interesting part will then be the breakdown of profitability in regard to\\nthe trade features like the timestamp, holding period, trade frequency, liquidity in\\nthe market, and the initial NFT price. Analyzing the initial cost of an NFT art\\nmakes it possible to answer if it’s an alternative for everyone, the broader mass. This\\nwork does not try to predict any future NFT art prices. Its purpose is to provide\\nan overview of the profitability and, eventually, the according risks. In the end, the\\nresulting advantages and disadvantages of NFT art investing will be faced in order\\nto answer the central question.\\n1', 'CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\\n2 Literature Review\\n2.1 Understanding NFTs\\nIn order to analyze NFTs and their characteristics as an investment alternative, it\\nis essential first to understand the underlying basic mechanics, such as blockchain.\\nTherefore, the following part will summarize individual parts of NFT art investing.\\n2.1.1 Blockchain\\nGomber et al. (2017) describe a blockchain as a sequence of data packages (blocks).\\nEach block consists of messages containing information about transactions. This\\nsequence is an ever-growing list maintained by a decentralized network of servers.\\nThe network uses a mechanism to reach a consensus on the transaction validation\\nwithin each new block. Cryptographic hash algorithms make it hardly impossible\\nto manipulate a blockchain. Nakamoto (2008) presented the first concept of a peer-\\nto-peer network for electronic payments using a blockchain known today as Bitcoin.\\nThe presented draft for payment processing using a blockchain made third- parties,\\nlike banks, unnecessary. With this new concept, the required mutual trust when\\nmaking transactions is replaced by blockchain technology. Over the past years, a\\nvariety of blockchains evolved. They can differ in purpose, functionality, or even in\\nthe used hash algorithm. The two blockchains with the largest market caps have been\\nfor years, and still are, Bitcoin and Ethereum. Measured in US-Dollar (USD), the\\nnative tokens of both blockchains have a combined market cap of more than $500bn,\\naccording to cryptowat.ch on 20 October 2022. It is not necessary to fully understand\\nthe technical mechanics how those blockchains work. As a potential NFT investor it\\nis important to know that anyone can see the full contents of the historic blocks of\\na blockchain (Chen, Cong, and Xiao, 2021, p. 4-5). This is crucial when comparing\\ntraditional art investing with NFT art investing. Regarding security, participants\\ncan check previous transactions and recognize potentially invalid transactions, and\\nthus, there is no incentive to validate fraudulent transactions. In order to motivate\\nthe network for the validation process, transaction fees incur for each transaction on\\nthe blockchain (Chen, Cong, and Xiao, 2021, p. 12-13). The resulting costs are often\\ncalled gas fees and are paid by the user triggering the transaction. These transaction\\nfees can be volatile and depend on the units of the data size gas, used as explained by\\nButerin et al. (2019) and visualized in figure 1. Gas fees increase when more people\\nuse applications that run on top of a blockchain’s network. The more users use the\\nblockchain the higher gas fees will be. This is caused by the competition of the users\\n2', 'CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\\nfor the space available in the next block. The process of writing a digital item to the\\nblockchain is also a transaction and is called minting. According to OpenSea, 2022b\\nminting establishes an unchangeable proof of authenticity and ownership.\\n2.1.2 Fungible and Non-Fungible Tokens\\nNFTs represent ownership of unique items, as initially described by Entriken et al.\\n(2018). They enable the tokenization of art, collectibles, or even real estate. The\\nfollowing paragraph provides a brief explanation of what tokens are and where the\\ndifferences between cryptocurrencies and NFTs.\\nWith the introduction of the Ethereum network Buterin (2014), a platform emerged\\nwith built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing for the creation and\\nexecution of various complex smart contracts. Smart contracts are codes that auto-\\nmaticallyexecutethepredeterminedcontentofanagreement, suchasreleasingtokens\\nonce the terms of the agreement are met (Alharby and Moorsel, 2017, p. 127-128).\\nSmart contracts are one of the reasons why Ethereum is the most popular blockchain\\nfor decentralized applications. Smart contracts also have their memory and account\\nbalance and can no longer be changed once connected to the blockchain. Transac-\\ntions are sent to the contract address, which is unique. After successful validation\\nby the network, the account balance of the contract is updated. There are different\\nstandards for different types of assets, so-called tokens, on the Ethereum blockchain.\\nERC-20, defined by Vogelsteller and Buterin (2015) is the standard for tokens on\\nthe Ethereum blockchain that have an identical value and are exchangeable. The\\nresult is ether (ETH), the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, introduced\\nby Buterin (2014) and further explained by Wood (2022). The standard for the\\nopposite, tokens on the Ethereum blockchain that have an identical value and are\\ntherefore exchangeable, is ERC-721. It is equivalent to the ERC-20 standard, but for\\ndistinguishable and unique tokens, which are not exchangeable, defined by Entriken\\net al. (2018). ERC-721 is supposed to be an open-source standard describing how to\\nbuild NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs, in general, are typically embedded\\nin such a blockchain, provided the blockchain has the required functionalities. Wang\\net al. (2021) wrote that the concept of NFTs originally came from the Ethereum\\nblockchain with the aim of distinguishing tokens with unique attributes. It is ques-\\ntionable if the concept of NFTs emerged from the Ethereum blockchain. The white\\npaper of so-called Colored Coins from Rosenfeld (2012) presented a similar construct\\nwhere real-world assets can be embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain as non-fungible\\ntokens. However, this idea has not caught on in practice. In order to interact with\\na blockchain and transfer cryptocurrency, a public key and a private key is required.\\nThe public key is the address to which the assets are allocated on the blockchain,\\n3', 'CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\\ncomparable to a bank account number. The private key makes it possible to instruct\\ntransactions from one address to another address. Anyone with access to this private\\nkey, typically consisting of a sequence of randomly generated words, has access to the\\nassets of the address on the blockchain. It is, therefore, essential to keep this private\\nkey safe. So-called wallets store the keys to the address of a blockchain. This wallet\\nmakes it possible to receive and sell cryptocurrency and NFTs. OpenSea (2022d)\\ndescribes how such a wallet can be set up in order to become an NFT investor, see\\nopensea.io/learn/what-is-crypto-wallet.\\n2.1.3 Usefulness of NFTs\\nTherearedifferenttypesofNFTs. Table1showstheavailablecategoriesonopensea.io,\\na major decentralized NFT exchange on the Ethereum blockchain (OpenSea). Next\\nto digital assets like photography or music, NFTs can also facilitate ownership of real-\\nworld assets. One example is the Basic Attention Token (BAT) proposed by Brave\\nSoftware (2021). The target is to implement a more efficient market in the adver-\\ntising space by introducing a system of opt-in advertising which shall increase users’\\nprivacy and improve publishers’ revenue. NFT collections like PROOF Collective\\nprovide ownership to an exclusive club when buying one of their limited 1,000 NFTs.\\nMore and more Web 2.0 companies build Web 3.0 applications and begin using NFT\\nin their business. A recent example is the company Meta (2022) introducing NFTs\\nto their social media application Instagram.\\nCategory Example Collection\\nArt Autoglyphs\\nCollectibles Bored Ape Yacht Club\\nDomain Names ENS: Ethereum Name Service\\nMusic SAN Origin\\nPhotography Women Unite - 10k Assemble\\nSports The NFTeams\\nTrading Cards Parallel Alpha\\nUtility Consortium Key\\nVirtual Worlds Decentraland\\nTable 1 NFT Categories\\nSource: opensea.io\\n2.2 Traditional Art Investing\\nThis work focuses on the NFT category art as an investment. In order to understand\\nthis new asset class, it is helpful first to get a basic understanding of traditional art\\n4', 'CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\\ninvesting. The following paragraph briefly explains how art pieces have performed as\\ninvestments in the past.\\nArt has been an alternative investment for many centuries. However, research on art\\ninvestments has been rare. First studies by Anderson (1974) have examined paintings\\nas an investment from 1780 to 1970. Their results show that art investments, on the\\none hand, can provide a positive annual return. On the other hand, the risk-adjusted\\nreturn is less attractive when compared with other investment alternatives. Existing\\nliterature quantifies the profitability of traditional art investments by creating an\\nindex of art prices. Anderson (1974) first approximated that following the mean-\\nvariance approach to portfolio theory, the total return must be similar to another\\nequally risky asset. They concluded that the price of a painting depends on the\\nartist’s reputation, the year it was sold, and the size of the painting. Risk return\\nratios of paintings can be compared with those of common stocks. Lower risk-return\\nratios may be due to the consumption value of the art. This is, of course, not 100%\\naccurate since only art prices on the primary market may go up, but investors can\\nnot sell their art on the secondary market, or at least not for a profit. This makes\\ncomparing traditional art with the NFT art market less significant. The analysis in\\nthisworkwill, therefore, alsoincludetraditionalassetclasseslikeabondandthestock\\nmarket index. Further studies from Goetzmann, Renneboog, and Spaenjers (2011)\\nwere still using an approach in 2009, similar to Anderson (1974). They investigated\\nthe impact of equity markets and top incomes on art prices. They constructed an\\nart index and tested for correlation between the art index, the stock market, and the\\nwealth of the wealthy. The wealth data used for their analysis rely on income tax data\\nof the top 0.1% income share. Their results strongly suggest a long-term relationship\\nbetween top incomes and part prices. In their words, \"it is indeed the wealth of\\nthe wealthy that drives art prices\". Rennebog and Spaenjers (2012) have studied\\nthe investment performance of traditional art with a more recent and more extensive\\ndata set than previous work has done. The analyzed data set ranges from 1957 to\\n2007, and comes to a similar conclusion that alternative investments in art can result\\nin high returns but come with high risk. Art critic Robert Hughes (1984) describes\\nart prices as an investment as an irrational and manipulable desire. A regression on\\nNFT art in appendix A.2 underlines this description of art prices. This is one of the\\nreasons why this work focuses on analyzing the historic NFT art profitability instead\\nof trying to predict prices.\\n2.3 Alternative Investment: NFT Art\\nTypical alternative investments are real estate, fine arts, wine, or collectibles, mainly\\nused to diversify investment portfolios. As the studies from the previous section\\n5', 'CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\\nportrayed, art investing had been a privilege where mostly wealthy investors added\\nart pieces to their portfolios. This shows the need for a better accessible and less\\nrestrictive way to invest in art. The new asset class NFT art is a potential solution,\\ncombining the new technology with traditional art. The following paragraphs provide\\nan overview of this new asset class, enabling alternative investments for the broader\\nsociety.\\n2.3.1 Market Places and Participants\\nThe most famous market places for NFT art are Nifty Gateway, Rarible, OpenSea,\\nor the centralized exchange Binance. OpenSea as the most prominent decentralized\\nexchange on the Ethereum blockchain, will be the focus of this work. According to it-\\nself, OpenSeawascreatedin2017andis, therefore, oneofthefirstNFTmarketplaces.\\nOpenSea believes that in the future, almost everything which can be owned will be\\nembedded on a blockchain. It says from itself that trust and safety is prioritized, and\\ninclusion and diversity are a big part of this marketplace. Possible blockchains on\\nOpenSea are, at the time of writing: Arbitrum, Avalanche, Ethereum, Klaytn, Opti-\\nmism, Polygon, and Solana. This work focuses on Ethereum transactions since it has\\nthe longest history of data and one standard: ERC-721. To be able to trade NFT art,\\nthere must be artists within this new world. On OpenSea, everyone having a crypto\\nwallet can mint their digital art and become a creator. Due to the pseudonymity\\nof blockchain technology, only the wallet addresses are visible of the market partici-\\npants. Within the past years, new communities emerged, discussing trends in NFT\\nart. Most of the discussions on NFT art happen on the social media platform Twitter\\nand the chatting application Discord, see discord channel members on discadia.com.\\nAddresses on the blockchain and buying NFT art pieces are called investors. Similar\\nto the artists, the pseudonymity of the blockchain makes it hard to tell much about\\nthe investors themselves. Although, it is possible to tell something about investors\\nbased on their behavior. As the data in the next chapter will show, most of the sales\\nfrom the sample happen on the same day of the purchase. This is already a sign of\\nbots, or at least a sign of investors not being interested in consuming the art as An-\\nderson (1974) described it. In times of artificial intelligence automatically generating\\nart and machine learning-driven bots automatically buying and selling digital assets,\\nit is thinkable that are whole NFT-art-bot-bubble will emerge. The analysis of this\\nwork will show that addresses that make a lot of transactions do not automatically\\ngenerate more profits than addresses with fewer transactions. A market driven by\\nbots can be highly manipulative and pose a severe risk to potential NFT art investors.\\nIt is up to the NFT marketplaces like OpenSea to regulate the use of bots, but it\\n6', 'CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\\nmight be in favor of marketplaces when bots create more trading volume, creating\\nmore fees.\\nFigure 1 Average Daily Transaction Fees on Ethereum Blockchain\\nSource: etherscan.io\\n2.3.2 Costs and Taxes\\nNext to gas fees applying to every transaction on the blockchain, costs for buying\\nor selling NFTs also include creator earnings and a marketplace fee. According to\\nOpenSea (2022c) creator earnings are set by the creator of the NFT. This allows\\nthe artist to profit from further reselling of his art pieces. The marketplace fee on\\nOpenSea amounts to 2.5% of each NFT sale price. According to Taulli (2022) NFTs\\nare treated as property by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the United States of\\nAmerica. TheregulationoftaxesonprofitsfromNFTtradesstillneedstobeclarified.\\nThe situation in Germany looks similar, where cryptocurrencies and NFTs are seen\\nas objects according to Winheller and Schwendemann (n.d.). There, a distinction is\\nmade as to whether the seller also created the art object or not.\\n7', 'CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW\\n2.3.3 Buying NFT Art\\nIn order to become an NFT investor, one needs to create a wallet. One of the most\\ncommon online wallet providers is MetaMask which can be accessed on metamask.io.\\nThis wallet provider is open source and offers a browser extension that can directly\\nlink to the marketplace, for instance, opensea.io. The desired art piece has to be\\navailableonthepreferredmarketplace. Tobeabletointeractwiththeblockchainand\\nbuy an NFT, one needs to have cryptocurrency like ETH. Opening an account on a\\ncentralcryptoexchangeallowsonetochangefiatmoneylikeUSDintocryptocurrency\\nand transfer it to the created wallet. The current biggest central exchanges are\\nbinance.com and coinbase.com, which require a KYC process and exchange fees.\\nThis implies that investing in NFT art also means taking cryptocurrency exposure\\ninto account. Finally, once selected an art piece and connected to the wallet to the\\nmarketplace, the NFT can be bought. On OpenSea, NFTs can be either bought\\ndirectly or acquired through an auction. A more detailed instruction on buying NFT\\nart is described by OpenSea (2022a). Requiring no KYC process implies the risk of\\nmoney laundering or other criminal activity. After Wang et al. (2021), it is up to the\\ngovernment to regulate the business of NFTs. Algorithms get better, and once illegal\\nmoney turns back to fiat money, criminals can be caught. Selling an NFT is similarly\\nsimple. Once the wallet containing the NFT is connected to the marketplace, one\\nsimply can put the art piece on sale for either a desired price or a timed auction,\\ndescribed by OpenSea (2022c).\\n2.3.4 Exisiting Work on NFT Art Profitability\\nExisting work on NFT art profitability, like from Kong and Lin (2021) analyzed the\\nsingle collection Cryptopunks which is one of the most significant NFT collections in\\nhistory. Cryptopunksarenotinthedatasamplebecausethedatasourceforthiswork,\\netherscan.io, theleadingdataproviderfortheEthereumblockchain(Etherscan), does\\nnot provide data for this collection. However, answering the main question of NFT\\nart as an investment alternative for everyone is not possible when only looking at one\\ncollection costing at several minimum tens of thousands USD. Kong and Lin (2021)\\nfind that NFT trades of the collection Cryptopunks can achieve high rates of returns.\\nThese high returns are accompanied by high volatility resulting in a Sharpe ratio\\nsimilar to one of the common stock indices like the NASDAQ index. The expectation\\nwould be similar results of traditional art investments where high returns face high\\nvolatility, but the major advantage of this new asset class is that all price categories\\ncan be traded in one place and are less restrictive. This hypothesis will be analyzed\\nin the following chapter.\\n8', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\n3 Analysis\\nThe previous chapters introduced the world of NFTs, traditional art investing, and\\nfinally, the combination of both: NFT art investing. This chapter puts the theory\\ninto practice. Analyzing historic NFT art investments provides insights that are espe-\\ncially relevant for potential investors considering entering the NFT art market. The\\nanalysisbeginswithdescribingtheavailabledataandpreparingitfordeeperanalysis.\\nIn the next step, the profitability is broken down in detail. By comparing contiguous\\ntransactions, the analyzed profitability represents realized returns by actual trades\\nand thus ensures practical relevance. At the end of the analysis part, the from the\\ndata induced advantages and disadvantages will be faced.\\nNote: data gathering, data clean-up, and analysis were all independently performed\\nusing python. All graphs included in this work were created independently and by\\ntheir own calculation, with the use of the described data. The according to code can\\nbe found on github.com/vfcapital/bachelor-thesis.\\nFigure 2 Transactions per Day\\nSource: Own calculation\\n9', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\n3.1 Data Description\\nThis section describes the data used to analyze NFT art investments’ profitability.\\nFirst, it needs to be decided which NFTs are being included in the analysis. As a\\nbasis, this work chose the top 100 art collections from OpenSea, as of 01 October\\n2022, 11:00 am CET. OpenSea is one of the major exchanges when it comes to\\nminting and trading ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, seeerc721.org.\\nThe top 100 collections ranking is selected by all-time trade volume measured in\\nEther, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain (ETH) and filtered by the\\nNFT subcategory \"art.\" For the period of retrieving the data, this work chose from\\n01 January 2019 until 03 October 2022. This might seem like a short time when\\ncompared to data sets of traditional art, where typically several centuries of history\\ninvestment transactions can be analyzed. As the previous chapter mentioned, NFTs\\nand their ERC-721 standard were first published in 2018. Hence, much longer periods\\nare just not possible. Looking at the finally retrieved data in the following section of\\nthe analysis, one will notice that most of the NFT art trades took place in late 2021,\\nsee figure 2.\\nCount of Collections 89\\nCount of NFTs 164,195\\nCount of Transactions 437,173\\nMedian Transaction Count per Collection 4,443\\nMedian NFT Count per Collection 1,814\\nMin.

Volume per Collection $967,988,903.95\\nTable 2 Total Transaction Volumes per Collection\\nSource: Own calculation\\nLooking at the transaction distribution, the analyzed data set raises questions about\\npotential selection issues. An argument against potential selection issues is that\\nthe selected top 100 collections are composed of all-time transaction volume, and the\\ncollection in the data set with the lowest transaction volume is called \"SUPERPLAS-\\nTIC: SUPERGUCCI\" with a total volume of $14,695.95. This relatively low all-time\\ntransaction volume indicates that essential NFT art collections are included in the\\ndata set. For comparison, the collection with the highest overall transaction volume\\nis \"BoredApeYachtClub,\" with a total of $967,988,903.95. More metrics on the data\\ncan be extracted from table 2. At this point, it needs to be noted that the data, on\\nthe one hand, contains primary as well as secondary market transactions since both\\n10', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\ntypes are possible on the OpenSea exchange. On the other hand, the data contains\\nonly actual successfully settled trades. The data from Etherscan comes directly from\\nthe Ethereum blockchain, ensuring high data quality. Additionally, in the following\\nsteps, the clean-up process of the data will be described in a short manner. It turns\\nout that after the data set clean-up, only 89 of the initial 100 retrieved collections\\nremain in the data set. A final count of remaining n=437,173transactions within\\nthe past 3.5 years can still be seen as a good representation of the overall NFT art\\nmarket.\\nPurchase Prices Sell Prices\\nCount 272,978 272,978\\nTotal Value $901,219,605.94 $1,486,589,361.26\\nMedian $971.97 919.58\\nMean $3,301.44 $5,445.82\\nStd.

Value Collection BoredApeYachtClub BoredApeYachtClub\\nTable 3 Trade Prices Overview\\nSource: Own calculation\\nWhile retrieving the data of each collection for this work, a strong pattern has been\\noccurring for most collections. Most of the transactions of each collection happened\\non the first days of launching the collection. This pattern matches the previous\\nchapter’smentionedbehaviorofNFTinvestorsalwayslookingforthefollowinghyped\\ncollection. This can also be shown in numbers. Across all collections, 5% of all\\ntransactions happen on the first day after the first trade was made. 51.30% of all\\ntransactions happen within the first ten days. Having the majority of trades within\\nthe first trading days displays a cluster risk in terms of liquidity. This issue will be\\ncaught up on in the discussion part. Another potential issue with the data set could\\nbe survivorship could cause bias in the analysis upwards, as Goetzmann, Brown,\\net al. (1992) exemplified. This potential issue is countered by the nature of how a\\nblockchainworks. Everytransactionsettledontheblockchainstaysontheblockchain\\nand can not be reverted. As long as OpenSea did not manually remove any collection\\nfrom the top 100 art collections of all time transaction volume, the list is complete.\\nNFT collections that are not traded anymore and lost their complete attraction to\\ninvestors are included in the analysis.\\nAs already mentioned and table 2 also shows only 89 of the initial 100 NFT art col-\\nlections remain for the final analysis. This is caused by the clean-up process. This\\n11', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\nProfits Holding Period in Days\\nMedian 3.45% 12.00\\nMean 881.10% 39.35\\nStd. Dev. 77,026.77% 61.10\\nMin.

The clean-up is required for the profit analysis of all initially fetched\\n775,592 transactions. The remaining 89 collections can be looked up in the appendix\\nA.1. This work starts with a table that contains the following columns:\\nTransaction Hash, Timestamp (inclusive milliseconds), Transaction Action Type,\\nBuyer Wallet Address, Collection Name, Token ID, NFT Type, Quantity, ETH Price,\\nUSD Price and Market Place\\nFirst, a unique NFT identifier is created by merging the collection name with the\\ncollection-specific token id. Since the token id is not a unique identifier, merging\\nboth columns into one makes further calculation easier. Next, checks are being run\\non the data to ensure that the marketplace is for all the same OpenSea. Similar\\nto the marketplace, a check ensures the NFT type equals the Ethereum standard\\nERC-721. The transaction action type has to be \"bought.\" This excludes some in-\\ncluded transactions where the investor won the auction, but the trade did not settle.\\nIn the next step, all transactions having a buy price of $0 are excluded from the\\ndata set. This might seem controversial to some. The background of $0 buy prices\\nis typically a marketing strategy for some selected investors, made by some collec-\\ntions. Potential investors can not rely on such special treatments, and the resulting\\nprofits from such transactions would bias the final results by increasing the mean\\nprofits significantly. The amount of such transactions is still low compared to the\\ntotal count of transactions. The following step cleans out a much higher number of\\ntransactions. In order to calculate realized profits of NFT art transactions, at least\\ntwo transactions are required per unique NFT id. Every transaction of unique NFTs\\nonly having exactly one transaction in the whole data set will be excluded from the\\nprofit analysis. Additionally, all duplicated transactions are excluded from the data\\nset. It is possible having multiple transactions with the same transaction hash. This\\nhappens on OpenSea when an investor buys multiple NFTs and pays them in one\\n12', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\npayment. But it is not possible having the same transaction hash and the same NFT\\nid.\\nOncetheclean-upisdone, 437,173transactionsremaininthedataset, whereactually\\nrealized profits can be calculated from. This is done by first sorting the table by NFT\\nid and timestamp. Afterward, the transactions from each unique NFT, unequal to\\nthe particular first transaction of each NFT, are shifted up to the prior transaction,\\nresulting in a new table. This new table represents actual trades, including the price\\nof the buy and the following sell transaction, which makes it possible to calculate\\nrealized profits.

ANALYSIS\\nFigure 3 Price History ETH\\nSource: coinmarketcap.com\\n3.2.1 Profit Distribution\\nLet’s start by looking at the plain returns distribution in figure 4. This histogram\\nshows the count of each profit bucket on the y-axis. The x-axis represents the profits\\nin 100%, calculated using the equation (3.1) and C=USD and F=2.5%. The dis-\\ntribution shows typical characteristics of log-normal distributed returns. All returns\\nexceeding 1000% of profit are included in the last bin, marked in pink, for visibility\\nreasons. The relative count of outlier trades having profitability of more than 1,000%\\nmakes up a small relative amount, with 0.4%. It might look like the majority of\\ntrades have a profit of less than 0%, but in total, 52.20% of the trades were profitable\\nin absolute values. Figure 5 shows the distribution of profitable investors. More pre-\\ncisely, it shows the count of wallet addresses who bought an NFT and sold it for a\\nlog-return in terms of USD.\\nComparing the transaction timestamps from 2 with the performance of the transac-\\ntion currency ETH in figure 3, one could argue that this was due to exchange rate\\nrisk. The ratio of profitable trades, measured in C=ETH, is almost the same at\\n53.81%. When comparing the log-returns calculated with ETH and the log-returns\\n14', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\nFigure 4 Profit Distribution\\nSource: Own calculation\\ncalculated with USD, the profits in USD are, on average, 81.49% higher. This di-\\nvergence is caused by some huge outliers. The median difference between the USD\\nprofit and the ETH profit is -0.3%, almost equal to zero, as figure 6 shows. The\\ndifferences are simply calculated by subtracting the profits using C=ETH from the\\nprofits using C=USD. As this plot of differences in ETH and USD profits shows, on\\naverage, both profits are equal. To make comparability easier, the following hedonic\\napproach of analysis of the NFT art profitability focuses on the profits measured in\\nUSD. This especially comes in favor of potential investors who are not yet active in\\nthe world of blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and NFTs.\\nThe outliers have been checked for this work. The one dot at the top of figure 6 repre-\\nsents the following trade: Address \"0xf2e4a3639b7dc9c7084ae59f7c511a9a1f807d1e\"\\nbought on the 15 September 2020 the NFT with id 271 from collection \"Auto-\\nglyphs\" for 0.005263 ETH ($1.92).

Therefore this work rather uses median values than\\narithmetic means for comparing profits and avoiding biases.\\nA better overview of the median log-returns can be found in figure 7. This graph\\nshows the median return per day across all trades in the data set. The seven-day\\nmedian includes fewer upside spikes in returns, avoiding that just a handful of days\\nin the sample distort the whole picture of profitability. This graph gives a good\\nindication of how the NFT art market went through a period of hype at the end of\\n2020 and the beginning of 2021. The median trade achieved profits between 100%\\nand 900%. This period of huge profits is followed by median log-returns settling\\ndown at around 100% in mid-2021. Comparing these numbers with stock market\\ntrades, for example, the returns are large. At the time of writing, the weekly median\\nlog-returns evened out at around 0% profit. This indicates that NFT art investments\\nhave become harder to gain profitability. Since these numbers do not include the\\nunderlying holding period of each trade, figure 7 does not tell much about the overall\\nprofitability of NFT art investing. Therefore it is necessary to dig deeper and break\\ndown the components of the trades.\\n17', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\nFigure 8 Profitability per Holding Period\\nSource: Own calculation\\n3.2.2 Holding Period\\nFigure 8 does exactly that. It shows the median log-return of each holding period\\nin days in the data set. For readability reasons, the graph only shows median log-\\nreturns of 1,000% or less. The median of possible holding periods measured in days is\\n12. Looking at figure 8, 12 days of median holding period might seem too small, but\\nthis represents an important investor behavior. 11% of buying and directly reselling\\nthe NFT happen within the same day. This behavior matches the way the NFT art\\nmarket was described in chapter two. The amount of NFTs issued per collection is\\nlimited. Additionally, many collections experience a big hype, even before the art\\nwas released. Those two factors lead to traders, or sometimes trading bots, being\\nlucky to get the NFT on release from the primary market and directly selling on\\nthe secondary market. Since the median log-return for a holding period of zero days\\nis positive, this trading strategy seems to add up relatively often. It appears that\\nin the mid-range holding period, the median log-returns all are negative. This fact\\nindicates that holding NFT art for several months had not been profitable in the\\npast. In the long term, a holding period of one year or longer, the median return\\n18', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\nFigure 9 Liquidity of the NFT art market\\nSource: Own calculation\\nprofits suddenly spike. These spikes can be explained by the relatively short time of\\nexistence of the NFT technology, especially the ERC-721 token standard. The data\\nset started in early 2019 whereat the count of trades and median returns of NFT\\nart began to rise at the end of 2020. On top of the rising NFT hype, as explained\\nabove, the exchange rate of ETH took off in the same time. Early investors from\\n2019 hence profited from both hypes. There are still median values in the negative\\nprofit area. This \"all or nothing\" pattern is typical for alternative investments in\\ngeneral and points out that NFT art might not be as comparable to investments in\\ncommon shares or bonds as many cryptocurrencies are. Such relationships will be\\ndescribed in more depth at the end of this analysis and are visualized in figure 14\\nand 15. Another part of the holding period graph (figure 8) is a linear regression of\\nthe second order. Holding periods within one year seem to fit this quadratic behavior\\neven though many data points are not in the 95%-confidence interval. Many data\\npoints being in the 95%-confidence interval would indicate that the profit could be\\npredicted plainly by the expected holding period. The Pearson correlation coefficient\\nbetween the profit and the holding period is 0.01, suggesting a low correlation. Table\\n5 in appendix A.2 shows a regression in the profits using the holding period as the\\n19', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\nexplanatory variable. The model was trained by randomly splitting the data into a\\ntrain and test data set. The quality of the regression can be quantified by the metric\\nR−squared measuring the share of variance from the regression model explaining the\\nvariance of the acutal test values. The results of this regression using Statsmodels by\\nSeabold and Perktold (2010) show a R−squared of zero, meaning these explanatory\\nvariables do not explain the behavior of the NFT art profits. Searching for potential\\ndrivers of NFT art prices in more detail is not part of this work.\\nIndex fund founder John C. Bogle (2010) compares short-term investing with long-\\nterm investments. He strongly suggests avoiding short-term trading. Among the\\nholding period, this work analyses how the trade frequency within the NFT art\\nmarket potentially influences the resulting returns. First, the trading frequency per\\ncollection is broken down. The number of trades per collection compared with the\\nfloor price of the according collection is negatively correlated, having a correlation\\ncoefficient of -0.36. This makes sense if assuming equally distributed liquidity. Lower-\\npricedNFTartcollectionsaretradedmoreoften. Inpractice, thedatasetofthiswork\\nshows that trade counts are not equally distributed over the initial price. Therefore\\nit is worth looking at the profitability per trade counts. Figure 10 shows the median\\nlog-returns per count of trades per collection. As the linear regression in this graph\\ndirectly suggests, the count of trades per collection has a relatively low but positive\\nimpact on the median log-return. The relatively small slope can be interpreted as the\\ncount of trades only having a small impact on log-returns and is not an important\\nindicator for potential investors. On the other hand, from the fact that the slope is\\npositive, it can be concluded that a higher trade count might lead to higher liquidity\\nand, therefore, a greater demand for that collection.\\n3.2.3 Liquidity\\nFigure 9 provides an overview of the total turnover across all NFT art transactions\\nper month for the last two years. Comparing this graph with the weekly median\\nlog-returns from figure 7, it appears that liquidity and profits don’t match perfectly.\\nComparing the liquidity spike in march 2022 with the median log-returns in that\\ntime, the log-returns should be higher if drawing the conclusion from higher liquidity\\nfollows higher demand, resulting in higher returns. Besides this difference in devel-\\nopment within those two graphs, the absolute change in total turnover had dropped\\nsignificantly compared to the time of the big NFT hype at the end of 2021 and the\\nbeginning of 2022. Where in march 2022, the total transaction volume of NFT art in\\nthe data set added up to almost half a billion USD, the total turnover in the last 30\\ndays of the data set in September 2022 only added up to 8 million USD and 13,311\\ntrades. As figure 9 visualizes this reduction in NFT art market activity, it is notable\\n20', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\nthat the count of trades decreased less than how the total liquidity has dropped.\\nThis indicates that the overall prices of NFT art have dropped significantly after the\\ndescribed hype.\\nAmongthetradespercollection, thefrequencyoftradesperinvestorandtheresulting\\nprofitability is relevant for potential investors. As Keim (2003) already analyzed\\nfor the stock market, chasing trends can be costly and inefficient. This work does\\nnot expect potential investors to implement complex momentum strategies. In an\\neasier fashion, the count of trades per investor can be compared with the resulting\\nmedian log-returns. A possible expected outcome would be that more trades imply\\nmore expertise of the investor within the NFT art space and therefore achieve higher\\nreturns. Figure 11 visualizes this comparison. Looking plainly at the median profits,\\nno obvious trend can be observed. Adding a linear regression line to the graph shows\\na slightly negative trend. This finding is underlined by most investors having traded\\nless than 100 times and achieved positive median returns. Considering this historical\\ndata, it can be desirable to also focus on qualitative factors when it comes to NFT\\nart investing.\\nFigure 10 Trade Frequency per Collection\\nSource: Own calculation\\n21', 'CHAPTER 3.

At the end of this analysis,\\npotential investors with relatively little money should have a first overview of wether\\nthis new asset class is a potential alternative investment. But before directly looking\\nat the data, it needs to be clarified how to measure the attractiveness of affordable\\nNFT art. For measuring profitability, this work follows Rennebog and Spaenjers\\n(2012) and mainly looks at the reward-to-volatility relationship measured by the\\nSharpe ratio.\\nThe Sharpe ratio first introduced by Sharpe (1998) is a practical way to measure\\nthe performance of an asset using historical data. It is calculated by subtracting the\\nrisk-free rate, usually the U.S. treasury bill, from the historic return of the asset and\\nthen dividing it by the volatility, measured by the standard deviation. For this work\\n22', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\nFigure 12 Profitability per Purchase Price Range\\nSource: Own calculation\\nthe return of the asset is the according to median log-return, for the risk-free rate,\\nthe 10-year treasury yield is used, which is quoted around 2% at the time of writing,\\nseetreasurydirect.gov.

According to the Governors of the\\nFederalReserveSystem(September2020)theconditionalmedianvalueofallfinancial\\nassets held by families in the United States rose 3% to $25,700 in 2019. To find an\\nappropriate investment amount, lets take these numbers from the federal reserve.\\n23', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\nFigure 13 Sharpe Ratio per Purchase Price Range\\nSource: Own calculation\\nAssuming the increase in financial assets only consists of initial investment without\\nany market movement, the investment amount was3%×$25,700\\n103%=$748.54in 2019. For\\nfurther profit breakdown, this number can be taken as a rough reference for retail\\ninvestment budgets. Figure 12 compares the different median log-returns of trades\\nclustered by their initial purchase price measured in USD. One will directly notice the\\nbucket having a purchase price of less than $100. The median log-return is almost\\n120%, by far the best-performing bucket. The mid-price buckets ranging between\\n$1,000 and $25,000 all have a negative median return. The more expensive NFTs,\\non the other hand, achieve positive returns on the median. A possible explanation\\nfor that pattern is that unpopular and relatively cheap collections go through phases\\nof hype after their release. NFTs in the mid-price range possibly do not get much\\nattention. This might reflect a bigger phenomenon, wealth inequality. As explained\\nby Keister (2000), there is a gap between the top one percent of the wealth of people\\nin America and the rest. Whereas the lower income segment inside the historic NFT\\nart investors mostly invests in NFTs costing $1,000 or less, the comparably wealthy\\ninside that space mostly invest in assets costing at least $25,000. As a result, the\\nmid-price segment gets excluded from phases of hypes.\\n24', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\nThese results might look promising and in favor of the affordable NFT art, initially\\ncosting less than $1,000. Figure 13 goes one step further and shows the above-\\nexplained performance metric, the Sharpe ratio per price range. Now, also taking the\\nvolatility of the log-returns into account, the lower price segment disappears entirely\\nfrom the graph. Trades of initially higher-priced NFT art remain visually profitable,\\nwhereas the mid-price segment still seems unattractive and demonstrates negative\\nSharpe ratios. By subtracting the risk-free rate from the asset profit and dividing\\nthe standard deviation, the uncertainty of achieving the above-displayed returns is\\nalso considered. Historic investors of lower-priced NFT art had achieved a median\\nlog-return of almost 120%, but the fluctuations among all log-returns had been so\\nlarge, making it difficult to calculate with such a median log-return for the future.\\nThe higher priced NFT art initially costing more than $100,000 achieved a positive\\nSharpe ratio of more than .5. These results match with the ones of Rennebog and\\nSpaenjers (2012), where expensive art turned out as profitable. For comparison, the\\nS&P 500 achieved a Sharpe ratio of 1.77 in the same time frame. The comparison of\\nthose two Sharpe ratios should not be taken too seriously since the NFT art returns\\nin the used data set are no time series like the S&P 500. For the calculation of the\\nS&P 500 Sharpe ratio, the total profit from the time frame mid-2019 till October\\n2022 was used. For the NFT art, the median profit of each price bucket was used.\\n3.2.5 NFT Art and Other Asset Classes\\nFor better comparability, this work created an NFT art index. Unlike traditional\\nhistoricartprices, thereturnsofNFTartcontainextremeoutliersofpartiallymillions\\nof percent in profit. To avoid biasing rare outliers, the monthly rolling median profit\\nwas used when creating the index visualized in figure 14.

As expected by previous insights from this\\nanalysis, the NFT art index demonstrates large up and down movements. The ether\\nprice represented by the dashed line shows the rise and fall of this cryptocurrency,\\nwhich is already known from figure 3. Comparing the NFT art index with the S&P\\n500, the differences in volatility stand out. While the stock market index S&P 500\\nsteadily increased up to 25% until the beginning of 2022, the NFT art index already\\nhad a roller coaster drive behind it. The NFT art index increased tenfold within a\\nfew months and dropped almost entirely right before multiplying by ten again. At\\nthe end of the sample period, the ETH price, as well as the NFT art index, increased\\n25', 'CHAPTER 3.

Such large returns do exist in other\\nasset classes but are comparably rare. NFT art pieces which were bought on the\\nprimary market for more than $100,000 were able to double in price or achieve even\\nlarger returns. Most of the higher returns were achieved by, the lower price segment.\\nTheinitialcostsforsuchNFTswere$1,000orless, whichmakestheseNFTsaffordable\\nfor many investors with relatively small investment budgets. The above results also\\nshow that it is not necessary to place a lot of trades within the NFT art space to\\nbecome a profitable investor. It might even be unprofitable to trade a lot. Another\\nbenefit is the diversification aspect. NFT art is almost uncorrelated with other asset\\nclasses. This might be one of the biggest reasons to buy NFT art, right next to the\\npossible large returns. There are not many alternative investments possible for retail\\n27', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\ninvestorswithsmallbudgets. Comparedtotraditionalart, NFTartiseasiertoaccess.\\nNo transportation costs are required to get to the auctions by easily accessing the\\nprimary market, just requiring a WiFi connection. But also reselling the art pieces\\non the secondary is possible in a minimalist fashion. Everything happens at the same\\nlocation, for example, OpenSea. There is no KYC, Know-Your-Customer verification\\nprocess required, which makes discrimination, for example, caused by racism, not\\npossible within the NFT space. This leads to the last big advantage of NFT art\\n- decentralization. Since NFTs from the ERC-721 are traded on the decentralized\\nblockchain Ethereum, NFT art investors can profit from decentralization. Compared\\nto traditional art, historical transactions of NFT art are completely transparent and\\nvisible on the blockchain. Additionally, many decentralized applications are open\\nsource, which allows users like NFT art investors to evaluate the exchange they are\\nusing, for example, in terms of safety and reliability.\\n3.3.2 Disadvantages\\nOne of the biggest disadvantages of NFT art investments is the short period of avail-\\nable data. Traditional art, other alternative investments, and common stocks provide\\na history in data of sometimes more than several centuries. The fact that NFTs and\\nNFT art as a new asset class has existed for only a few years makes it difficult to\\ncompare with other investment types. Nevertheless, this work tries to bring some\\nlight into this new world of investments. Besides the short period of data being avail-\\nable, the short median holding period attracts attention and might be concerning\\nto some potential investors. Intraday trades reflect the majority of holding periods\\nacross the whole data set of NFT art trades. While the median profit of intraday\\ntrades is positive with a median profit of 11% and a mean profit of 1,167%, many\\ninvestors want to buy and hold long term instead. Relatively long-term investments\\nof one year or more demonstrate a nothing pattern. This means investors can earn\\nthousands of percent in return, or they can lose their entire stake. Another drawdown\\nfrom NFT art investments is the relatively high exchange rate risk. As a European\\ninvestor purchasing asset in the U.S., there are exchange rate risks caused by the Euro\\nto USD rate. Historically these fluctuations are not comparable to the volatility of\\ncryptocurrencies. As long as cryptocurrencies like ether are not commonly used in\\neveryday life, chances are high that an investor wants to convert their NFT art profits\\nback to fiat currency like USD or EUR and, therefore, must take the relatively high\\nexchange rate risk. Not only volatility in cryptocurrency prices but also the relatively\\nhigh volatility in the investment returns itself represent a disadvantage of NFT art\\ninvestments. The commonly used metric Sharpe ratio makes affordable NFT art in-\\nvestments look unattractive. Thousands of percent in returns do not compensate for\\n28', 'CHAPTER 3. ANALYSIS\\nthe high volatility. Another risk of NFT art investments is, at the time of writing, the\\nlack of liquidity. In the last month, the total turnover across the data set summed up\\nto $8 million in September 2022. Comparing this number with almost half a billion\\nUSD in the total turnover beginning of 2022, the liquidity fluctuation represents a\\nserious risk. It is possible that there are simply not enough buyers anymore when\\ntrying to sell the art piece. In addition to the total liquidity, there is also a cluster\\nrisk of liquidity. 51.30% of all trades happen within the first ten days of trading of\\neach collection. This might even lead to a kind of survivorship bias as explained by\\nGoetzmann, Brown, et al. (1992). If NFT art cannot be sold, it won’t appear in the\\ndata set since there is no return to measure. This kind of risk may put pressure on\\ninvestors to sell their NFT art pieces already after a short period of time. Another\\ndownside of NFT art investments is the uncertainty about transaction fees. While\\ntransaction fees are directly referred to the marketplace like OpenSea, the gas fees\\ncan fluctuate and may lead to eliminating profits, especially in the lower price seg-\\nment. The last drawdown of NFT art investments is the tax situation which is still\\nunclear in many countries and depends on the individual investor. Common stock\\ninvestments, on the opposite, are typically well regulated, and many brokers carry\\nthe tax part for an investor.\\n29', 'CHAPTER 4. CONCLUSION\\n4 Conclusion\\nThe results of this work have shown that NFT art investments can provide returns of\\nseveral thousand percent. Especially lower priced art of the analyzed data performed\\nwell. When looking at the Sharpe ratio, the lower-priced art loses that attractiveness.\\nThe risk-return relationship is similar to that of traditional art investments. The\\ngap between extra-ordinarily high returns and big losses reminds one of the pay-\\noff structures of venture capital investments as described by Cochrane (2005). This\\nindicates that NFT art can act as a serious alternative investment. Besides the high\\nvolatility in trade returns, the NFT art market is subject to cluster risk regarding\\nwhen trades occur after the first day of trading. This makes it desirable to buy\\non the primary market and sell the asset sooner rather than later. Additionally,\\nliquidity depicts a risk because the total turnover dropped from half a billion to only\\neight million USD in September 2022. Another effect of investing in NFT art is\\nthe implied investment in cryptocurrency. This comes with additional exchange rate\\nrisk. NFT investors should either want to invest in cryptocurrencies anyway or use\\nfinancial instruments to hedge against this risk. Besides the risks, the high returns\\ncome with costs. The analysis has taken the fixed market price fee on OpenSea of\\n2.5% into account. But the volatile gas fees incurred for every transaction on the\\nblockchain and the variable creator fees, ranging from zero to ten percent, need to\\nbe considered before investing. A common point of criticism of blockchain in general\\noften is environmental concerns. This can be opposed by the transition from proof-\\nof-work to proof-of-stake, called the merge. As described by Ethereum.org (2022),\\nthe energy consumption of the Ethereum blockchain could be reduced by 99,95%.\\nConcluding it can be said that, yes, NFT art can represent an investment alternative.\\nInthepast,investorswithallbudgetsizeshadaccesstothisnewtechnology. Potential\\nnew investors need to make themself aware of the risks of NFT investing.\\nThe future of NFTs continues to be interesting. NFT art prices and trade activity\\nhave dropped in the first quarter of 2022. The decrease might be due to the multiple\\ncrises around the world in 2022. In the meantime, prices of almost every other asset\\nclass have decreased. More and more mainstream companies are using NFTs in their\\nbusiness, like Meta (2022) with their social media app Instagram. In times of bots\\nusing artificial intelligence, generating high-quality art, like DALL ·E 2 by OpenAI\\n(n.d.), and bots automatically buying and selling digital assets, the risk of an NFT\\nbot bubble potentially emerges.\\n30']\n"
